    <h2>CONTENT OF THIS ANIME "DEMON SLAYER"</h2>
    <p>Tanjiro is a kind-hearted boy who lives with his family in the mountains. 
        One day, he returns home to find that his entire family has been slaughtered by demons, 
        with the exception of his younger sister, Nezuko. However, Nezuko has been transformed into a demon. 
        Despite this, she still shows signs of human emotions and even protects Tanjiro. 
        Determined to find a cure for Nezuko and avenge his family, 
        Tanjiro becomes a Demon Slayer, a member of an organization dedicated to hunting down demons.
         Throughout the series, Tanjiro and his friends face various powerful demons,
        and the show is known for its intense and emotional storytelling,
        well-choreographed fight scenes, and beautiful animation produced by studio Ufotable</p>
